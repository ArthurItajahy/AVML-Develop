# Avium Language (.avml)

Welcome to the official repository for **Avium Language (.avml)**, a programming language designed to automate and optimize interstellar missions in **Kerbal Space Program (KSP) 1.12.1**. Inspired by tools like kOS, Avium Language offers a robust scripting environment for controlling spacecraft with precision and efficiency.

## What is Avium Language?

Avium Language is a lightweight yet powerful scripting language tailored for:

- Automating spacecraft maneuvers.
- Writing efficient and reusable scripts for interstellar missions.
- Managing complex mission profiles with ease.

With Avium Language, you can:
- Calculate delta-v requirements.
- Execute orbital transfers and gravity assists.
- Automate staging, burns, and docking procedures.
- Create robust mission logic for interplanetary exploration.

## Features

- **KSP Integration**: Specifically designed for KSP 1.12.1, ensuring seamless interaction with the game.
- **Lightweight Syntax**: Focus on writing clean and readable code.
- **Advanced Automation**: Handle everything from basic burns to multi-stage missions with complex dependencies.
- **Mod-Friendly**: Compatible with mods like Realism Overhaul and RSS.

## Example Script

Hereâ€™s a simple example of an Avium script to perform a prograde burn:

## Example Scripts

### Avium Language (.avml)
Hereâ€™s a simple example of an Avium script to perform a prograde burn:


```avml

// Import necessary modules
import Autopilot;
import Ship; // Ship information like DeltaV, WetMass, DryMass, Fuel, etc.

// Initialize autopilot and ship objects
// Set up autopilot
Autopilot autopilot = Autopilot();
// Ship information
Ship ship = Ship();

// Activate autopilot and set direction
autopilot.activate();
autopilot.setDirection("prograde");

// Burn parameters
int targetDeltaV = 1000; // Delta-v in m/s
while (ship.getDeltaVExecuted() < targetDeltaV) {
    autopilot.setThrottle(1.0); // Full throttle
}

// Stop the burn
autopilot.setThrottle(0.0);
autopilot.deactivate();

```
