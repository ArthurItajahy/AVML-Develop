## Example Script

Hereâ€™s a simple example of an Avium script to perform a prograde burn:

```avml
// Set up autopilot
activate autopilot;
set direction to prograde;

// Burn parameters
set targetDeltaV to 1000; // Delta-v in m/s
while remainingDeltaV > 0 {
    throttle to 1.0;
}
throttle to 0.0;
deactivate autopilot;
```
